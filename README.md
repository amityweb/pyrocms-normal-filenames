Normal Filenames for PyroCMS Uploads
====================================

PyroCMS is great, but has this annoying and quote frankly SEO detrimental issue in that it names file uploads some uncontrollable random characters. Want those nice keywords for SEO reasons in your image name? Ugh ugh, no way. 

The files in thie repo are core file changes to ensure file uploads retain their filenames, and also for the WYSIWYG editor to display and insert the images with these nice filenames too. 

This is not tested with the user front end editor, nor tested with private files, so may need additional work.
